# Multi-Agent Bug Finder using ADK

This project demonstrates a multi-agent system using Auto Dev Kernel (ADK) to detect bugs in Python code samples.

## Project Structure
- `sample_code/`: Contains Python files with intentional syntax and logic errors for testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies, including ADK.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. (If ADK is not on PyPI, install it per the official instructions.)

## Usage
Run the multi-agent bug finder (instructions to be added in later steps).
